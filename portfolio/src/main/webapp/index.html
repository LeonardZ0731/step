      <p id="self-intro">Hello everyone, I'm Leonard Zhang. You can call me Leonard. I’m a rising junior at Carnegie Mellon University, 
        pursuing a bachelor degree in Computer Science and Applied Math. In my spare time, I love playing basketball and 
        video games with my friends. Also, I really enjoy hiking with my family members during the vacations. Because of 
        my interest in games, I love developing some small games with my friends during my spare time. It’s such a great 
        fun playing the games developed by my own. Thus, developing games is one of my biggest passions. </p>
